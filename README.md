## DuckAI class

The DuckAI classes is used to retrieve chat results from DuckDuckGo.com.
```python3
class DuckAI:
    """duckai class to get search results from duckduckgo.com

    Args:
        proxy (str, optional): proxy for the HTTP client, supports http/https/socks5 protocols.
            example: "http://user:pass@example.com:3128". Defaults to None.
        timeout (int, optional): Timeout value for the HTTP client. Defaults to 10.
        verify (bool): SSL verification when making the request. Defaults to True.
    """
```

Here is an example of initializing the DuckAI class.
```python3
from duckai import DuckAI

results = DuckAI().chat("python programming")
print(results)
```

## Proxy

Package supports http/https/socks proxies. Example: `http://user:pass@example.com:3128`.
Use a rotating proxy. Otherwise, use a new proxy with each DuckAI class initialization.

*1. The easiest way. Launch the Tor Browser*
```python3
duckai = DuckAI(proxy="tb", timeout=20)  # "tb" is an alias for "socks5://127.0.0.1:9150"
results = duckai.chat("something you need", model="mistral-small-3")
```
*2. Use any proxy server* (*example with [iproyal rotating residential proxies](https://iproyal.com?r=residential_proxies)*)
```python3
duckai = DuckAI(proxy="socks5h://user:password@geo.iproyal.com:32325", timeout=20)
results = duckai.chat("something you need", model="mistral-small-3")
```
*3. The proxy can also be set using the `DUCKAI_PROXY` environment variable.*
```python3
export DUCKAI_PROXY="socks5h://user:password@geo.iproyal.com:32325"
```
